            <h2>accountability and the nature of will</h2>

                An individualist perception of human action has long invaded Western thought which serves to place accountability of "wrongdoing" on the individual rather than on the society which breeds the relevant conditions -- the conclusions reached through this line of thought serve only to reinforce the perceived supremacy of liberal democracy.
                <br><br>
                The first, more obvious outcome is the blame placed on minority populations rather than the conditions they are born and raised within. It causes the individual minority to be held to a higher standard by their peers to avoid "giving us a bad name," knowing that the bourgeois commentators will not stop to analyze the conditions which gave rise to violence and instead blame "black-on-black violence" or "free borders" as entirely separate phenomena, intentionally giving rise to eugenic thought. This additionally allows law enforcement to claim retroactively that they act more "carefully" around African American or Mexican or Arab subjects due to higher rates of crime, rather than acknowledging that their subjugation led to these conditions (not that they should acknowledge these; it is obviously outside of their interest).
                <br><br>
                The second outcome is the blame of the self: choosing a less profitable university major, saving less to spend more on a loved one, failing a job interview, not working diligently enough. Individualist perception forces one to subjugate himself subconsciously in every regard as one tries to reconcile the gap between their real efforts and their rate of success. Capitalist societies will always prioritize the dissemination of this paradox to each of their subjects as a preventative measure against class consciousness and therefore revolution.
                <br><br>
                More sentimentally, the understanding of determination of our actions by forces outside our individual control serves to better the understanding of individual accountability by a proletarianized individual as opposed to one who lacks class consciousness and refuses to see the conditions which cause a certain "thief" or "criminal" to act as such. This is not to remove responsibility from the individual, but instead to acknowledge that violent crime would be less frequent following a revolution and the cultural revolution which it entails as reaction is purged -- a decline in hate crimes and a lack of financial disparity would reduce societal violence.

                This topic frequently comes up in conversations with family about religion (why did God create initial conditions which would lead to human suffering), but that line of thought begs the question of whether individual humans have any real agency at all? Dialectic analysis allows us to understand previous evolution of human societal structure and how it corresponds to our future, but it is interesting to wonder whether analysis itself may evolve to allow us to view more specific future outcomes.
                <br><br>
                And as life is such a series of contradictions and resolutions, our lives are only consequences. Our agency emerges from fighting contradiction. Our empathy extends beyond "bearing witness to suffering"; our aspirations more real than a distant dream of inexplicable peace and prosperity. To form a better world is to understand the forces which act on us and the extent to which we can act on them. Why confine ourselves to reform? To watching ourselves die ten thousand kilometers away? To resignation?
                <br><br>
                And each of us have a million ambitions and aspirations and passions and small enjoyments which shape our identities and the way we spend our limited time here, shaped by forces set in motion billions of years before any conceivable idea of us could ever exist, and yet expressed through the mind and body of every last one of us. Every mind which has existed ever has dreamt and dreamt despite how far away those whose shoulders we stand on may seem. Every person is personable; we are no different. Our processes evolve under the same dialectic laws which governed our progress from the slave system to the feudal system hundreds of years ago. The same processes have shown themselves as contradictions in worker-bourgeoise relations as the first bourgeois revolutions which liberal democracy ultimately did not solve all contradiction present.
                <br><br>
                As time continues to pass, these contradictions only become more apparent, in the name of a village bombed in conquest, or a house burned to the ground. We will learn not to blame themselves in the stead of the system which would crush us by the heel and the fighter plane before seeing our aspirations come to rise. The endless cycle of self-blame is one of the most insidious elements of capitalist society and the alienation and atomization which we face as indiviuduals can be extremely difficult to reconcile. But yet our reality is obviously not the harshest as those living within the imperial core enjoy the imperial spoils, while those in the periphery suffer to bring goods to America or Britain or France. Fanon's detail of the psycho-affective space puts into perspective the contradictions present even in the mind of the colonial subject as he struggles with extreme injustice and humiliation. Any concept of "justice" can only be idealist with such a horrid inequality present.
