            <p>
                Welcome!
                <br><br>
                This is not the first iteration of this site; I initially used jekyll's integration with Github Pages to host a site using a premade template, which worked well! It was my first real project, and was my introduction to html, css, markdown, and ruby. Eventually, I wanted to try creating a site from scratch instead, which is the work-in-progress you see now!
                <br><br>
                Part of writing is style, and I've seen how mine has changed as I look through past assignments and other writings (they were bad!). I hope to look back at what I've wrote here in a few years and be impressed with how far I've come, both in style and in the knowledge which shapes the writing itself.
                <br><br>
                The content of the site came after. I enjoy writing, and am trying to improve at it, so this is my attempt at that. I wanted a place to record my writing attempts and a way to share them with people, along with customizability which is hard to obtain outside of owning the site itself (which worked nicely with my hope to begin learning html and css as well).
                <br><br>
                I (conveniently) enjoy the look of older, more barebones websites, but in the spirit of learning to create a proper website, I will be upgrading the look of the site as I add more submissions and learn more about css; enjoy the Revachol background in the meantime!
                <br><br>
                I am currently a university student studying chemistry! I play violin (pretty well) and electric guitar (barely). I have also been getting myself to read more and will write about books I've read as I complete them.
                <br><br>
                I listen to a lot of metal and will always recommend Gojira to people (usually multiple times), specifically their first album (Terra Incognita) and their third album (From Mars to Sirius); all of their live albums are also amazing! I also recommend Deafheaven (listen to Sunbather!) and Opeth (Ghost Reveries and Blackwater Park).
                <br><br>
                For books I've read, I can absolutely recommend Wretched of the Earth by Fanon; it is an incredible read and gives unbelievable insight into colonizer-colonized relations through both the colonial and independent stages. I will continue to update this section as I progress through my reading list. Next for me to read are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Black Reconstruction by Du Bois</li>
                    <li>State and Revolution by Lenin</li>
                    <li>Blackshirts and Reds by Parenti</li>
                    <li>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong</li>
                </ul>
                I hope you enjoy your stay!
