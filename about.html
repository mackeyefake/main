            <p>
                Welcome!
                <br><br>
                This is not the first iteration of this site; I initially used jekyll's integration with Github Pages to host a site using a premade template, which worked well! It was my first real project, and was my introduction to html, css, markdown, and ruby. Eventually, I wanted to try creating a site from scratch instead, which is the work-in-progress you see now!
                <br><br>
                The content of the site came after. I wanted a place to record my attempts at writing and a way to share them with people, along with customizability of the page which is hard to obtain outside of designing the site itself. I hope to look back at what I've wrote here in a few years and be impressed with how far I've come, both in style and in the knowledge which shapes the writing itself.
                <br><br>
                I (conveniently) enjoy the look of older, more barebones websites, and so the overall feel of the website will likely not change drastically; but in the spirit of learning to create a proper website, I will be upgrading the look of the site as I add more submissions and learn more about css.
                <br><br>
                As for myself, I am currently a university student studying chemistry! I play violin (pretty well) and electric guitar (barely). I have also been getting myself to read more and will write about books as I complete them. I am currently reading Wretched of the Earth by Fanon and plan to read these next:
                <ul>
                    <li>Black Reconstruction by Du Bois</li>
                    <li>State and Revolution by Lenin</li>
                    <li>Blackshirts and Reds by Parenti</li>
                    <li>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong</li>
                </ul>
                I also will begin to add links as other projects go live. I have a lot of things I'm working on slowly and am excited to share them as they near completion (eventually; c# is hard). 
                <br><br>
                I listen to a lot of metal and will always recommend Gojira to people (usually multiple times), specifically their first album (Terra Incognita) and their third album (From Mars to Sirius); all of their live albums are also amazing! I also recommend Deafheaven (listen to Sunbather!) and Opeth (Ghost Reveries and Blackwater Park).
                <br><br>

                I hope you enjoy your stay!
